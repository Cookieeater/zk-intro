Imagine we are building a large circuit and we need to do the same multiplication many times. The most convenient option would be to put this into a template and reuse it as needed (I'll show how reuse looks later).\n",

After the word **signal** there can be words **input** or **output**. Signals with such keywords are visible from outside. By connecting **input** signals with other signals, we can get the **output** signal. Signals inside the template without the **input/output** keyword are not visible from outside and can only be used inside the template. The last component is the signal name, here it's *a, b, c*.\n",

More details can be found [here](https://docs.circom.io/circom-language/constraint-generation/). In short, this construction allows us to connect signals and impose restrictions on such connections. Constraints must be represented in the form A*B + C = 0. Several syntactic constructions related to this:\n",

    "##### 5.2) **C === a * b** - same as in 5.1, parts of equality can be swapped\n",
    "##### 5.3) **x <-- a * b** - the arrow serves to create connections between signals, while this syntax does not generate and is not a constraint (!), but only assigns the new value a * b to signal x.\n",
    "##### 5.4) **a * b --> x** - same as 5.3\n",
    "##### 5.5) **x <== a * b** - this is a short notation for two expressions: **x <-- a * b** and **x === a * b**. This exact notation is found above in the example. Most often **<==** is used rather than **<--**. Later I'll show why **<--** can be dangerous and how it can be useful. You can write the arrow in the other direction too (**==>**)."
